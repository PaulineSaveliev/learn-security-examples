- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?


vulnerability:
The vulnerability leis in the fact that in the event an attack occurs 
on the server, there is no way to determine where the attack came from,
what happened, or who was responsible. In the secure version, there is 
a middleware function that logs every request in a secure file. It 
writes the timestamp, method called, request, and ip address of who 
made the request, making it easy to track down when something went 
wrong. It also has error handling in the event that the writing to the 
log encounters an issue. It automatically goes to the next middleware,
which sends a response to the server and prevents the crash. In this way,
the more secure server prevents denial of service by preventing a crash 
while also tracking the causes of a potential crash


security to add:
- maintain log to track information associated with an attack
    - who caused the server to fail
    - their ip address
    - timestamp of an event
    - what their inputs were 
    - what they were trying to access
