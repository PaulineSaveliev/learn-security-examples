- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?


The vulnerability lies in the fact that a mongoose query (findOne) is
called with an id value that potentially comes from attacker-controlled
input. Since there is no sanitization of input and no error handling,
invalid attacker input crashes the site if something goes wrong, preventing
the server from being functional and denying service. The secure server
ensures that errors are caught using mongoose's built-in findOne id 
verification.


security mechanisms:
- add error handling, so that the site doesnt crash with invalid input
    - try/catch on query, or any other part
- sanitize the input
