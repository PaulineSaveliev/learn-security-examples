The vulnerability in the program lies in the fact that there is no
authentication. An attacker could pass in an admin's username and pretend
to be an admin, thus unlocking new privileges that they should not have.
They could give a new role to other users or downgrade the role of the 
actual admin. In the secure example, sessions are used to add 
authentication, which requires a key for sercurity.

prevent it:
- add two-factor authentication
    - then anyone requesting the sever will be an authenticated user
- define endpoints in such a way that only admin can acess those endpoints
    - strong authentication with sessions or two-factor
