Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the 
secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the req.sesion.user value 
is used to determine the identity of the user. The value is set 
based on user input in the /register endpoint without any validation
or verification, so an attacker could input their code to set the 
session user value to something else (such as "Admin") and 
getting access to private information through the /sensitive endpoint,
which they would then have access to.

In secure.js, the vulnerability is addressed with the addition of 
a secret key. This key is used to sig the session ID cookie, which
makes it much harder for the attacker to impersonate another user. The 
code also sets httpOnly and sameSite to true in the session cookie, 
preventing client-side JS from accessing the cookie.
