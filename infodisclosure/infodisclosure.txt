Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does information disclosure violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The vulnerability is on line 26, where the user-input username is
used in the program witout being sanitized. This allows the user to 
input code and retrieve the endpoints of the program, thus making
them able to enter those endpoints and access restricted information.


Information disclosure violates the confidentiality property, since 
the malicious user would then be able to access data they do not have
permission to be viewing.

Additional security mechanisms would include sanitizing the user input,
so that if the user attempts to input code that would cause a breach 
the input is rejected. You can also add authentication so the user cannot
access restricted data, along with not logging sensitive information like
passwords, since the log can be accessed. Encrypting the data would also
help prevent information disclosure.
