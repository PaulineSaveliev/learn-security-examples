Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version 
prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?


One vulnerability in the code is that user-provided values are used
in a mongoose query to query the databse, so a hacker can input their 
code or a SQL statement to retrieve or modify sensitive data without
authorization. 

In the secure version, the code checks whether the input is a string,
throwing an error if the input is not a string. This prevents foreign code
from being executed. The user input is also sanitized if it is a string
to prevent any SQL statements and further prevent the 
possibility of an injection attack.

Tampering violates the "confidentiality" CIA property, since data 
can be accessed without authorization. "integrity" can also be violated
if the injecttion attack adds or modifies the existing data isntead of
accessing it.

Additional security mechanisms that could be incorporated
